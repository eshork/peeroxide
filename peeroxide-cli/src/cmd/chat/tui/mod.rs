//! Interactive terminal UI for `peeroxide chat join`.
//!
//! Two implementations of [`ChatUi`] are provided:
//!
//! - [`line::LineUi`]: byte-compatible with the historical behaviour —
//!   line-oriented stdin, `println!`/`eprintln!` to stdout/stderr. Used when
//!   stdout is not a TTY, when `--line-mode` is passed, or when
//!   `PEEROXIDE_LINE_MODE=1` is set in the environment.
//! - [`interactive::InteractiveUi`]: full TTY mode with a status bar pinned at
//!   the bottom of the terminal, multi-line input area, slash commands, and
//!   chat history flowing through a scroll region above.
//!
//! Pick one via [`make_ui`]. Callers (i.e. `join.rs`) interact only through
//! the [`ChatUi`] trait, so the two implementations are interchangeable.
